Data Sets:
* Educational Attainment for the Population 25 years and over 
(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/12535b2e-6180-4cdf-b7d8-ec5294259e49)
Description from the WPRDC: Educational attainment data are needed for use in assessing the socioeconomic condition of the U.S. population. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.
* Tax Delinquency in Pittsburgh (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-of-pittsburgh-property-tax-delinquency/resource/ed0d1550-c300-4114-865c-82dc7c23235b?inner_span=True)
Description from the WPRDC: This dataset contains all property in the City of Pittsburgh that is delinquent on property taxes for the given year.
* Wage or Salary Income in the Past 12 Months for Households (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/d159c6b3-f70a-439b-bd2b-0cb8735d76d4)
Description from WPRDC: Wage or salary income includes total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the past 12 months. It includes wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions, tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc.


Abstract:
Our group looked at three metrics for determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. The first of these three metrics was higher educational attainment for the population 25 years and over, particularly by percentage of doctoral degrees among residents. The second was lower tax delinquency rates, and the third was higher household income over the last 12 months. We determined that XXXX is the best neighborhood because it ranked the highest among all three categories: XX in educational attainment, XX in tax deliquency, and XX in household income.
