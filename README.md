Data Sets:
* Educational Attainment for the Population 25 years and over 
(https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/12535b2e-6180-4cdf-b7d8-ec5294259e49)
Description from the WPRDC: Educational attainment data are needed for use in assessing the socioeconomic condition of the U.S. population. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.
* Police Incident Blotter (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data)
Description from the WPRDC: The Police Blotter Archive contains crime incident data after it has been validated and processed to meet Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards, published on a nightly basis. This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.) The data set largely contains data updated since 1/1/2016.
* Wage or Salary Income in the Past 12 Months for Households (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-miscellaneous-data/resource/d159c6b3-f70a-439b-bd2b-0cb8735d76d4)
Description from WPRDC: Wage or salary income includes total money earnings received for work performed as an employee during the past 12 months. It includes wages, salary, Armed Forces pay, commissions, tips, piece-rate payments, and cash bonuses earned before deductions were made for taxes, bonds, pensions, union dues, etc.


Abstract:
Our group looked at three metrics for determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. The first of these three metrics was higher educational attainment for the population 25 years and over, particularly by percentage of doctoral degrees among residents. The second was lower crime per capita rate, and the third was higher household income over the last 12 months. We determined that XXXX is the best neighborhood because it ranked the highest among all three categories: XX in educational attainment, XX in per capita crime rate, and XX in household income. 


Presentation Information:

* THE METRIC: highest educational attainment, lowest per capita crime rate, and highest household income. The datasets are linked above in the README.
